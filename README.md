## 🚀 What Drives Me

I believe great systems don't just work — they scale, they secure data, and they empower people.

That's why I'm committed to building infrastructure as code, streamlining DevOps pipelines, and developing backend systems that solve real-world problems.

I'm currently sharpening my skills in:

✅ Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)  
✅ Backend Engineering (ALX_SE)  
✅ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)  
✅ Automation, Security & System Reliability
